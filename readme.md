#Flask App Organization and Blueprint
- I created the main "home" blueprint for my flask application.
I also moved my routes file into the 'home' directory, more specifically, within the home blueprint.
  I implemented the application factory pattern and the organization benefits of a blueprint with docker.
  This structure works and runs, as tested using docker container.
